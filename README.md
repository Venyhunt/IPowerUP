IPowerUP

Gamified Learning Platform for Intellectual Property Awareness

IPowerUP is an interactive web application designed to introduce students to the world of Intellectual Property (IP) through games, videos, and engaging activities.

The platform explores four major areas of IP:

Copyrights

Trademarks

Trade Secrets

Patents

Features

Interactive mini-games (such as Sudoku-inspired puzzles) built around IP concepts.

Educational videos that simplify complex topics and make them accessible to students.

A user-friendly design tailored to school students for an enjoyable learning experience.

Modular structure where each IP type functions as a separate learning space.

Purpose

Intellectual Property rights are central to creativity and innovation. However, they are often taught in ways that feel boring or inaccessible. IPowerUP bridges this gap by presenting IP through interactive, game-based learning, helping students understand these concepts in a fun and practical way.

git clone https://github.com/Venyhunt/IPowerUP.git

Future Improvements

Add more interactive modules and quizzes.

Expand to cover advanced topics in IP law.
